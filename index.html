        <h4>New School Canteen</h4>

        <p class="list-group-item-text col-ig-7 col-nd-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-7">All the corridors of the school should lead to the canteen but unfortunately, it is in a corner of the school. It has a small window through which the canteen incharge supplies us snacks, tea and cold drink. Our principal has allowed a stall of ice cream in the canteen. There are two other counters for books, stationery and beverages. It is mostly the parents who visit the stationery counter. The students go there only under compulsion. Their most favourite spot is the ice cream corner. The students flock round it and buy the ice creams that are available in different flavours.

 

          Their mouths water at the sight of ice cream and they want to break the queue to have it first. The second favourite counter is that of beverages. They wash down their lunches with some cold drink or a cup of tea. They sip it slowly so that it could last for the whole period. As the bottle starts showing its bottom, their speed also decreases. They glup down the last drop with a heavy heart as if it was the end of their friendship with the bottle.</p>

      <h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>
      <img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-ig-12 col-nd-5 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
      <p class="list-group-item-text col-ig-7 col-nd-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-7">Key Functions of an Online Attendance Management System
        Daily attendance reports, absentee lists, letters, and other documents can be easily created using this system. Student attendance systems save teachers time by allowing them to record student attendance during class electronically. It is used to keep track of a student’s attendance, absentee history, and other relevant records. The daily attendance process can be sped up using student attendance software to manage and record daily attendance efficiently.
        
        Benefits of Online Attendance Management System for Schools
        Compliance issues, payroll discrepancies, and student proxy attendance are some issues that schools deal with. Let us understand how an online attendance management system with the following functionalities helps schools:
        
        Track the working hours of staff
        As it keeps track of the employees’ check-in and check-out times, the software aids the institute in evaluating the overall effective working hours of the teachers. 
        
        Effectively calculate the rate of absenteeism
        The software assists in determining the rate of absence for both teachers and students. It enables the school to determine when replacement teachers are needed to cover for the absent staff. It helps keep the parents and teachers informed about students’ absenteeism records and maintains student discipline.
        
        Quick report generation
        The online attendance management system can quickly generate reports such as student-wise attendance, day-wise attendance, class-wise attendance, month-wise class attendance, and much more. In fact, current and back-dated reports can also be made available.
        
        Reduce costs and increase accuracy and data security
        The software makes attendance management hassle-free and saves time by preventing repetition of  tasks. Automation prevents human error, and the backups in the cloud enhance data security.
        
        Real-time attendance analysis
        This feature leads to error-free attendance tracking while allowing teachers to devote more time to teaching students. 
        
         
        
        The schools can decrease administrative work, save time and money, and eliminate labour-intensive attendance procedures by switching from paper-based timesheets and attendance to automated attendance software.
